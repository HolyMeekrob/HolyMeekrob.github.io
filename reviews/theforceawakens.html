		<h2>Review - Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens</h2>
		<p>
			In this review, I will attempt to demonstrate that not only is Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens a bad movie, it is in fact the worst movie in the series. I know this statement sets off a few alarms in many reader's heads. First, it looks like hyperbole, especially when I throw in the statement that it cements JJ Abrams as the worst filmmaker in Hollywood. Second, it seems reactionary given that I am writing this review on the day after the film's release. Third, considering the relatively high amount of praise that it has thus far received, it sounds contradictory for the sake of attention. I affirm that, despite appearances, it is none of those things, and that I firmly believe in my thesis from the point of view of a Star Wars fan.
		</p>
		<p>
			Before continuing, understand that the review necessarily contains massive spoilers. <span class="bold">DO NOT CONTINUE READING IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILM AND DO NOT WANT TO BE SPOILED.</span>
		</p>
		<h2>Plot</h2>
		<p>
			To start with, I want to review the plot from a high level before getting into some of the details. The plot of this movie seems to be pretty simple, as things generally are in the Star Wars universe. Here was have a smaller subplot specific to Episode VII within a larger plot of what I assume will be this trilogy.
		</p>
		<p>
			The former of those, the plot specific to this movie, is Star Wars: The Search For Skywalker. Everyone wants to find Luke. Which is understandable. Luke Skywalker is a Jedi. The last in existence (again, since he went from being the last in existence to having students to all of his students being...dead?).
		</p>
		<p>
			The Resistance? The Rebellion? The Republican Army? (I'll get into that later in the review) wants to find him so that they can&hellip;.well they don't explain it, exactly. In fact, they don't explain anything about what The R Army is trying to do. We don't see any glimpses into the ongoing war, we just know that there's a war over something. At no point is there any R Army strategy to the war until like eleven planets get blown up (something I'll go into more detail shortly), and the R Army decides that they probably shouldn't let that happen again. So Luke fits into their lack of plans somehow. Maybe they need him to come up with a plan? Who knows?<br><br>The First Order? Empire? Is there an Empire? Is it just The First Order? If so, what is their goal? Do they even have a populous? If not, where do they get their stolen from birth Stormtroopers &nbsp;from? Do they have to steal them from birth since they don't have a populous? Is it just a couple dudes with mad brainwashing skills? Anyway, the Empire wants to find Luke so that they can...what? Turn him to the dark side in order to win the war? No, that doesn't seem to be the plan. And what good would that do when they can blow up like eleven planets at a time? So that Kylo Ren can complete his transition to the Dark Side? Because that would be worse than, I don't know, murdering his father somehow? No, that can't be it. Also, Giant Bald Emperor says he can complete his training without them having Luke. So they can kill him so they don't have to fight him? No, he's a hermit and he's not fighting, so that can't be it.
		</p>
		<p>
			So everyone wants to find Luke, but the only reason seems to be because Mark Hamill wants to get paid and he'll help sell movie tickets, I guess.
		</p>
		<p>
			Then you have the plot of the trilogy, which I guess is that the Empire wants to destroy the Republic, which is back somehow, and take over again. So they start by blowing up the Republic's planets. They don't say which ones, but it's like eleven of them. And from the looks of it, heavily populated ones. And immediately before that, Hux gives a Hitler speech where he tells us that when they fire the gun, the Republic will be gone. So uhh, I guess that plot is over.
		</p>
		<p>
			Except the army still exists. So now you have the army but no government that it's fighting for and, what I assume is a heavily depleted population. At this point, you could call them a resistance force, as they are resistance the Empire, but they are called a Resistance before that, which makes no sense, since they seem obviously affiliated with the Republic, which I can only assume is a legitimate governing body. About as much thought was put into that name as the rest of the story.
		</p>
		<p>
			But here's the thing. The Empire knows where the army is. Their second target group are their military sites. But their plan is foiled because the Resistance, the only military force in the galaxy that is capable of stopping them, is still around to stop them. Why the hell wouldn't the Empire have destroyed the military first and then the government? There was a 100% chance of success if they did it that way. It seems the writers didn't think things through.
		</p>
		<p>
			And what is the goal of the Empire? In Episode IV, the Death Star is meant to intimidate the rebels. They're not trying to kill everyone. They make a strategic decision to sacrifice one planet (that they know to be home to rebels) in order to bring peace through the threat of force. The First Order seems to just want to blow shit up because it's cool. It's like the writers thought, &ldquo;How do we one-up the Death Star? Let's make it even bigger and let it blow up lots of planets all at once! That's really evil!&rdquo;
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally let's specifically focus on the climactic scene where the Reb...Resistance takes out the Dea...Starkiller using a fleet of fighters. First of all, the plan was far too complex to be successful. Especially since Stormtrooper Jar Jar (more on him later) said he had a plan that he couldn't reveal on how to take down their shields, which was step one out of like five that all had to go right and in order.
		</p>
		<p>
			So Stormtrooper Jar Jar gets there reveals, lo and behold, he doesn't know what to do. So they decide to capture his former commanding officer and make her tell them what to do. What we know about her in particular and these troopers in general is that they are brainwashed, have no regard for human life, and live to serve Empire, not themselves. So of course it makes sense that she'd agree to whatever they ask because they have a gun pointed at her? Well at least she can make empty threats while she acquiesces.
		</p>
		<p>
			At some point Chewy set off some explosives, which did something, I'm not sure what, and then X-Wings started doing &ldquo;bombing runs&rdquo; on a thing despite the fact that they are air-to-air dogfighting ships and they should be using actual bombers like B-Wings to blow it up.
		</p>
		<p>
			Then the thing that is like, the size of ten Death Stars, so basically a planet, decides to send its entire fleet of ships at the Resistance force, which turns out to be like a dozen TIE Fighters. Because that seems reasonable.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, I want to talk about the lightsaber duel between Kylo, Stormtrooper Jar Jar, and Rey, and how it reveals the true pit of awfulness that is Episode VII. Kylo begins by fighting Stormtrooper Jar Jar, who is wielding a lightsaber that he has used once before, in a fight against a random &nbsp;Stormtrooper, and that he lost badly to. Kylo has force powers and training.
		</p>
		<p>
			Briefly, let's go back to the Episode V fight between Luke and Vader. At this point, Luke has had some training and is at least somewhat able to channel the force. And Vader wrecks him. Hard. Eventually Vader puts his lightsaber away and just throws shit at him because that's all he needs to do against a lesser foe.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm not saying Kylo Ren is Vader, but Stormtrooper Jar Jar sure as shit isn't Luke. And Ren STRUGGLES to beat him. Like, takes a few licks first struggles. And can't even finish him off before Rey gets up. And what happens when Rey gets up? She beats the everloving shit out of Kylo. At this point, Rey has never wielded a lightsaber in her life, and only realizes she has force powers during the fight itself! Granted, Kylo was injured. He had just taken a direct hit from a bowcaster that, previously, was shown to take out multiple stormtroopers in a single shot. But Kylo just has a flesh wound for some reason that's probably just inconsistent writing like so many other things.
		</p>
		<p>
			When Episode I invented a totally sweet foe named Darth Maul, they had a badass lightsaber fight with him vs. two Jedi, and at the conclusion of which, they killed him, because he had served his purpose. He didn't have a personality, he was there to kick ass and chew gum, and they ran out of both.
		</p>
		<p>
			Kylo Ren was a less good at fighting, less cool looking Darth Maul, but they decided he needed to be kept alive for some reason, so a rift showed up out of nowhere before Rey could finish him off. And even though she's instantly good at everything she tries, I guess she doesn't know about force jump yet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Contrast this with Ren at the beginning of the movie who is holding blaster fire in the air while doing other things and in general running around being Vader like. The inconsistency of his power is evidence of the lack of thoughtfulness that went into the movie as a whole.
		</p>
		<h2>Sentimentality and Nostalgia</h2>
		<p>
			I don't have a lot to say about this category except that every time they try it, it feels heavy-handed or even, at times, dishonest. Indeed, a lot of the plot points and characters tie directly back into the original trilogy. You have a new Jedi / aspiring pilot just discovering their powers (Luke/Rey). You have a charismatic pilot (Han, Poe). You have a masked villain in black who likes to use the force to hurt people (Vader, Ren). You have a cute boopity-bop Droid (BB-8). You have a planet shattering weapon (Death Star, Starkiller) that needs to be destroyed using X-Wings. You have a search for an old Jedi Master (Kenobi, Luke). You have your origins on a desert planet (Tatooine, Jakuu). You have a place to get information and travel full of all kinds of aliens (Cantina, Maz's Place). You have an evil ass military leader (Tarking / Hux). You have the enigmatic evil overlord (Emperor, Giant Bald Emperor). You have Han Solo being hunted down for money that he owes. You have the tragic death of one of our heroes (Kenobi, Han). And there's tons more.
		</p>
		<p>
			Additionally, you get this weird sentimental shit like when Han and Leia reunite. There's a romance movie moment where she puts her head in his chest and closes her eyes and smiles or something dumb, and the camera holds it for like five seconds. This is the woman we are supposed to believe is the commanding general of the entire Resistance military. The same Leia that was fierce and independent in the original movies and her relationship with Han wasn't lovey dovey at all like we're seeing (I'll get to that a bit more later). It feels fake and inconsistent with what we know about those characters, and their relationship is less likeable or interesting this way.
		</p>
		<h2>Characters</h2>
		<h4>Leia</h4>
		<p>
			Speaking of Leia, what the hell happened to her? She's the general of the army (outranking Ackbar? I couldn't tell, but that seems stupid if so) and yet she doesn't seem to know what she's doing or even care that much. Maybe that's why the Resistance is fiddling its thumbs. She needs to ask people like Stormtrooper Jar Jar for ideas. She's also too weak to be mad at Han for bailing on her, and she's too weak to go after her estranged serial killer son her damn self, so she asks Han to do it. Leia went from strong female heroine to screen turd. It reminds me of what Indiana Jones IV did to Marion's character, only this time you can't blame George Lucas.
		</p>
		<h4>Han</h4>
		<p>
			Han mostly gets out of this movie unscathed, probably thanks to Harrison Ford being awesome. His death scene, which I'll get to, was terribly done, and the aforementioned scene with Leia was bad. The only other part that I thought sucked was when the two different criminal organizations worked together (because that's a reasonable thing to happen) to approach him at the same time demanding money, so we could have a forced &ldquo;Same ol' Han!&rdquo; moment. In that scene, Han Solo seemed more like a caricature of himself than anything else.
		</p>
		<h4>Luke</h4>
		<p>
			Here's what we know about Luke. He tried to train a bunch of Jedi, including Kylo Ren. Kylo Ren did something (killed?) all of them and then escaped. Luke, having let this happen somehow, got super depressed and became a hermit. This is the same Luke who abandoned all reason multiple times in order to help his friends and the Rebellion. Now he runs away and stares at oceans off of cliffsides all day long. Unless someone shows up and then he stares at their hands forever. And we're supposed to feel relieved when they find him.
		</p>
		<h4>R2-D2</h4>
		<p>
			He's in standby mode because he's depressed? Give me a fucking break. And then he comes out of it because they have the star map and he can go find his friend Luke, except that even when they get the star map he still stays depressed for a while and continues to hide the star map that only he has and no other computer in the Resistance has. Yep.
		</p>
		<h4>>BB-8</h4>
		<p>
			Let's call him what he is. Star Wars Wall-E, a character made to sell merchandise to people who already have R2-D2 shit, and move on.
		</p>
		<h4>Maz</h4>
		<p>
			Don't stare at anything. Because why? Because that makes the next scene more ominous. Except that that bar has no danger about it, Maz is a completely nice, 100% good character with nothing shady about her, and the denizens seem happy to take Stormtrooper Jar Jars wherever they want to go with no questions asked. And she has Luke's lightsaber but they can't explain why that makes any sense because it's a long story or something, I don't know. And oh yeah the lightsaber has magic memory powers now.
		</p>
		<h4>Poe<</h4>
		<p>
			When writing the movie, someone probably said, &ldquo;Hey let's combine Han Solo's &lsquo;tude with Wedge's piloting&rdquo; and then JJ Abrams, if it wasn't his idea, thought that was just wonderful. They gloss over how he survived the crash, didn't run into Stormtrooper Jar Jar, didn't seem to try to look for the droid that was the entire reason he was on the damn planet, and escaped without the Empire finding him. They also decided to make him the best fighter pilot in the history of the galaxy. Well, at least until Rey gets two minutes of flying time under her belt (more on that below). There's a scene where he gets like six confirmed kills in three seconds. Why does the Resistance even have other pilots? Just send him in to take out the entire Empire. You can give him any gunner, because he apparently can train them to fire the guns on a ship he has never flown before, while flying the ship he has never flown before better than anyone has ever flown it. At least if that gunner has the Luck of Jar Jar trait, anyway. Because in this movie, if you have a name, and you're not Stormtrooper Jar Jar, then you're the best person in the galaxy at whatever you specialize in. Or you're Rey and you're the best person in the galaxy at literally everything, but more on that in a bit. Also, one thing Poe and Stormtrooper Jar Jar have in common is they like to say things like, &ldquo;Wow that person is a great ______&rdquo; whenever someone with a name does something ridiculously well, just so that the audience can keep up and understand that the character with a name is really good at the thing that they do!
		</p>
		<h4>Rey</h4>
		<p>
			One of the stupid things Episode VII does is dumb down the force. Previously, you couldn't just be strong in the force to be able to wield it purposefully. The ways in which Episode IV Luke or Episode I Anakin were able to use the force was passively. It helped them with things like intuition or reaction. Actual mastery over techniques took a willing teacher and extensive training. But this movie couldn't wait for any of that, so it created Rey -- the force user who is good at literally everything she attempts, but she learns specific powers with the force that, historically, only a Jedi Master could summon (such as Force Persuade) in under a minute, and before she even fully recognizes that she has the ability to wield the force (as seen when the realization comes to her during a lightsaber fight, during which, once she realizes it, is able to go into a meditative state whilst pushing against her foe's lightsaber, and then come out of the state more powerful than before, which is not something that any other Jedi ever has done ever). Here is a list of all the things that Rey is immediately a galaxy-class expert at the first time she attempts them: piloting the Millennium Falcon, complicated Electrical Systems, shooting and aiming blasters, lightsabers, force persuasion, force mind reading, force mind reading resistance. She's so good, that when the gun on the Falcon breaks such that it's stuck in one firing position that she can't see, she's able to evade enemy fire, drastically change speeds, flip the Falcon around aim the cannon exactly at a moving, oncoming enemy TIE Fighter such that all Stormtrooper Jar Jar has to do is pull the trigger. Once again, every character with a name in this movie is the greatest person in the galaxy at whatever they attempt to do.
		</p>
		<h4>Kylo Ren</h4>
		<p>
			I could probably write an entire review about how bad Kylo Ren is, but here is the thing that I think sums it up the best. What made Darth Vader awesome was two things. One is that he starts off as the most menacing bad dude of all time. Anyone who challenges his badness learns quickly and severely how bad an idea that is. And yet the original trilogy is about Vader's redemption. It is his inner and outer struggle to overcome his previous mistakes, to get out of the hole he has dug himself, and to do what's right and good in the end. You would never guess that by the end of Episode VI, you'd be rooting for the fellow.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here's why that's not going to happen with Kylo Ren. Because his struggle is that he has good parents and a supportive family and he has to fight everything they taught him and raised him to be so that he can willingly be evil. Vader wasn't willingly evil. He was manipulated into it. Not Ren. He's conscious of the choices he's making. He's completely and utterly unsympathetic, and the only reason we're given is so that he can be like Grandpa Annie.
		</p>
		<p>History is written by the victors. You know who won in Episode VI? Luke. Luke won. Luke gets to tell everyone the truth behind Vader and the Emperor. You think Kylo Ren only hears the Episode IV stories of Vader? Hell no. He knows the whole thing. He just ignores it.
		</p>
		<p>
			>What makes an interesting villain is when they believe they are doing good. Maybe it's that the ends justify the means, maybe they truly believe that the means themselves are good. For one reason or another, they are not doing good, or are at least doing enough harm that the good isn't justified. That's a villain. Kylo Ren doesn't seem to believe that he's doing anything good. He wants to be bad for badness sake. How can a character like this be at all interesting?
		</p>
		<p>
			He's just a rebellious kid. But what is he rebelling against. His parents weren't strict. There's no mention of regret between Han and Leia for anything wrong they did in bringing him up. They let him train with his savior of the galaxy, all-around good guy who saved Vader's soul uncle Luke. His father is literally the coolest dude in the entire galaxy. And he's emo about all of that?
		</p>
		<p>
			And let's talk about Han's death, which is easily the worst part of the movie. So Han shows up, is willing to ignore/forgive all the evil shit that his son has done. Says he can still come home, that he's still loved, that his parents accept him for who he is. Absolutely everything you'd want in a parent. And then Kylo, in a scene that's as telegraphed as every other scene in Episode VII, says he needs Han's help to do what he needs to do, which we all know is kill Han. And Han says that he'll do anything to help his son. Which apparently meant, put your hand on my lightsaber so that I can kill you. What? How does that help Kylo overcome his conscience at all? Han didn't egg him on. He didn't offer him anything but support. If anything, that action would have the exact opposite effect of what Kylo wanted.
		</p>
		<p>
			The whole, Kylo is good deep down but wants to be bad is complete lip service. It's them telling us that there's a complex character when there's nothing to him. He's completely empty. He's a shell of a character. Kylo Ren is the worst character in the history of Star Wars, and that's including Jar Jar and also&hellip;.
		</p>
		<h4>Stormtrooper Jar Jar</h4>
		<p>
			Let's compare Jar Jar and Stormtrooper Jar Jar. Both of them are alienated from their home. Both of them are clumsy and constantly falling over or getting captured. Both of them are bad at pretty much everything they attempt, but then stumble/luck into succeeding. Both of them lie about who they are because they are nobodies but want to be taken seriously. Both of them feel a half step out of sync with everyone else, like they are in a movie and say things that make no sense within their own world, but only make sense to us, the viewers who inhabit a totally different world. Both of them are essentially tagalongs to the people who actually matter. Both of them exist to offer commentary on what's happening in the world. How many times does Stormtrooper Jar Jar point out a character who just did something really well? Face it, Stormtrooper Jar Jar is Jar Jar. The only difference is that he doesn't talk in a ridiculous voice or make cartoonish facial expressions. If you think Episode I is terrible because it has Jar Jar as a major character, well Episode VII has Stormtrooper Jar Jar.
		</p>
		<h2>The Good Stuff</h2>
		<p>
			Not everything was bad. The dogfighting was some of the best in the series. Chewy is cool as always, and so is his bowcaster, which got way more use and I was happy to see that. Han Solo was good in most of his scenes. And the effects were cool and didn't get in the way at all. That's about it.
		</p>
		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>
			I think at this point I've given enough evidence to show that Episode VII is not a good movie. Yet I go beyond that and consider it to be the worst Star Wars film, and here's why. It doesn't offer anything new and it doesn't do anything important well. The characters are flatter than in any other movie. They are archetypes of archetypes, with no flaws whatsoever. Even the prequels at least had characters like Qui-Gon.
		</p>
		<p>
			Another difference is that a lot of the things that people hate about Episode I or the other prequels, you could take out of those movies and not lose much, if anything. You can take out Jar Jar and lose basically nothing. You can take out Anakin's escapades on the Naboo Fighter or any mention of midichlorian and have the same movie. But in Episode VII, every major character is bad. The plot is bad. The fight scenes that aren't dogfights are bad. You can't take this stuff out and still have a movie. You have nothing. You take out Kylo Ren and you have lost your main villain. You take out Rey and you've lost pretty much everything else.
		</p>
		<p>
			George Lucas made Episode I for children. JJ Abrams made Episode I for&hellip;.children too slow to understand Episode I?
